Write a hangman game that randomly generates a word and prompts the user to guess one letter at a a time, as shown in the sample run.
 Each letter in the word is displayed as an asterisk.  When the user makes a correct guess, the actual letter is then displayed. 
 When the user makes a correct guess, the actual letter is displayed.  When the user finishes a word, display the number of misses
 and ask the user whether to continue to play with another word.  Declare an array to store words, as follows: 

Store 20 different words in a text file, read them into an array. Randomly pick a number 1..20 and use this word for the current round.
